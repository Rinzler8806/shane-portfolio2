      'I had the honor to work with Shane on several projects for the 2020-2021 UC Davis Full Stack Developer Certificate Program. Our final project, Pangea Chat, integrated all of the software development areas for the client and server that we studied. Although our team of four members had no formal hierarchy, Shane quickly took the role of lead engineer. He organized and directed our team throughout the projects conception, design, development, test, deployment, and presentation phases. I highly recommend Shane for any full stack engineer position that requires knowledge and experience with HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, and Heroku.',
